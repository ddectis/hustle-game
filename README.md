# hustle-game
HustleTime is JS a clone of the classic TI-86 calculator game "Dope Wars". I created this project as a javascript learning exercise. It's build in vanilla javascript. I wrote all of the code with the exception of the random library that was shared with me by my friend Dave Kirkbride. Thanks Dave!

The goal of this project was to increase my javascript skills by building a simple, bug-free, event-driven game. I've achieved those goals with this project! The code is a mess but future projects will focus more on architecture and organization. The focus on this project was functionality. 

# Game Overview
In HustleTime the player is tasked with saving Grandma's Combination Animal Rescue and Orphanage. Grandma has $1M in back taxes and 30 days to pay them. I added this moral objective because the game itself is, well, in a bit more of a moral gray area i.e. to raise the money, you buy and sell drugs. 

- Basically, HustleTime is a simple market simulator.
- Each commodity has a price range and each day, the prices are randomized.
- The player starts out with $2,500 and owing $5,000 to a local mobster. Player has 7 days to pay the debt.
- That debt earns 20% interest / day
- The player earns profit by buying low and selling high.
- There's a shop to buy upgrades to increase max health + carrying capacity
- The player may get mugged while travelling around. If mugged, the player loses health and inventory.
- So there's a weapons shop where the player can arm themselves to defend against mugging.
